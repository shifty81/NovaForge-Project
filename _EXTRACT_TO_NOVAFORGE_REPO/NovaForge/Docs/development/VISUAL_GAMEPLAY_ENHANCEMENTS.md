**Date**: February 6, 2026  
**Goal**: Mimic EVE Online's visual appearance and gameplay mechanics

---

## Overview

This document outlines the visual and gameplay enhancements made to Nova Forge to closely mimic EVE Online's appearance, feel, and mechanics. All implementations are based on extensive research of EVE Online wikis, gameplay videos, and official documentation.

## Implemented Features

### 1. ✅ 3D Interactive Star Map

A fully interactive 3D star map system mimicking EVE Online's F10 map interface.

**Features**:
- **Galaxy View**: Displays all solar systems as 3D nodes with connections
- **Solar System View**: Shows detailed view of a single system with celestials
- **Tactical Overlay**: In-space range and positioning indicators
- **Interactive Navigation**: Mouse controls for zoom, pan, and rotate
- **Route Planning**: Automatic pathfinding between systems
- **Waypoint System**: Add multiple waypoints for complex routes
- **Data Filtering**: Filter by security status and faction
- **Visual Coding**: Color-coded by security (green=highsec, yellow=lowsec, red=nullsec)

**Implementation**:
- Header: `cpp_client/include/ui/star_map.h`
- Source: `cpp_client/src/ui/star_map.cpp`
- Uses separate camera for independent map control
- Efficient rendering with VAO/VBO for systems and connections
- BFS algorithm for shortest route calculation

**Controls**:
- `F10` - Toggle star map
- `1` - Switch to galaxy view
- `2` - Switch to solar system view
- `R` - Reset camera
- Mouse drag - Rotate map
- Mouse scroll - Zoom in/out
- Mouse click - Select system

**Color Scheme** (EVE Online style):
- Highsec (≥0.5): Green
- Lowsec (0.1-0.4): Yellow/Orange
- Nullsec (<0.1): Red
- Current system: White
- Destination: Cyan
- Route: Light blue line
- System connections: Gray lines

### 2. ✅ EVE-Style Ship Movement Physics

Realistic ship movement system based on EVE Online's physics model.

**Key Features**:
- **Exponential Acceleration**: Ships accelerate quickly at first, then approach max velocity asymptotically
- **Mass & Inertia**: Ship agility based on mass × inertia modifier
- **Align Time Mechanics**: Time to reach 75% max velocity (warp threshold)
- **Space Friction**: Ships decelerate without thrust (non-Newtonian)
- **Navigation Commands**: Approach, orbit, keep at range, warp
- **Propulsion Modules**: Support for afterburners/MWDs

**Implementation**:
- Header: `cpp_client/include/core/ship_physics.h`
- Source: `cpp_client/src/core/ship_physics.cpp`

**Physics Formula**:
```cpp
// Exponential acceleration toward max velocity
v(t) = v_max * (1 - e^(-t * k))
where k = ACCELERATION_CONSTANT / agility
      agility = mass * inertia_modifier
      
// Align time (time to 75% velocity)
t_align = -ln(0.25) * agility / 1000000
```

**Ship Classes** (example stats):

| Ship Class | Mass (kg) | Inertia | Max Vel (m/s) | Align Time |
|-----------|-----------|---------|---------------|------------|
| Frigate   | 1,200,000 | 3.2     | 400           | ~3-4s      |
| Destroyer | 1,800,000 | 4.5     | 320           | ~5-6s      |
| Cruiser   | 10,000,000| 5.5     | 250           | ~8-10s     |

**Navigation Modes**:
- `MANUAL` - Direct control of heading
- `APPROACH` - Move toward target to specified range
- `ORBIT` - Maintain circular orbit at specified range
- `KEEP_AT_RANGE` - Maintain distance from target
- `WARPING` - Align and jump to destination
- `STOPPED` - Decelerate to zero velocity

## Conclusion

These enhancements bring Nova Forge significantly closer to the look and feel of EVE Online. The implementation focuses on:

1. **Authentic mechanics** - Physics and navigation matching EVE
2. **Visual fidelity** - Color schemes and UI matching EVE's style
3. **Performance** - Efficient rendering for large-scale scenes
4. **Extensibility** - Easy to add more systems and features

The foundation is now in place for a truly EVE-like experience, with the star map providing intuitive navigation and the ship physics delivering the characteristic feel of EVE's spacecraft.
