# New Gameplay Systems - Phase 3

This document describes all the new gameplay systems added in Phase 3 to bring Nova Forge closer to the full EVE Online experience.

## 🏭 Manufacturing System

**File:** `engine/systems/industry_system.py`

### Features
- Blueprint management (BPO/BPC)
- Material Efficiency (ME) research (0-10 levels)
- Time Efficiency (TE) research (0-20 levels)

### Components
- `Blueprint` - Blueprint data (item, materials, efficiency)
- `BlueprintInventory` - Collection of blueprints owned
- `Inventory` - Item storage with capacity management
- `ManufacturingQueue` - Active manufacturing jobs

### Key Methods
```python
industry = IndustrySystem(world)

# Start manufacturing
job_id = industry.start_manufacturing(entity, "rifter_blueprint", quantity=2)

# Research blueprints
industry.research_material_efficiency(entity, "rifter_blueprint")
industry.research_time_efficiency(entity, "rifter_blueprint")

# Copy blueprints
industry.copy_blueprint(entity, "rifter_blueprint", runs=10)

# Check jobs
active_jobs = industry.get_active_jobs(entity)
```

### Data Files
- `data/industry/blueprints.json` - Blueprint definitions and materials

---

## 💰 Market System

**File:** `engine/systems/market_system.py`

### Features

- NPC base prices

### Components
- `Wallet` - Credits currency storage
- `MarketAccess` - Market location and active orders
- `MarketOrder` - Individual buy/sell order

### Key Methods
```python
market = MarketSystem(world)

# Place orders
order_id = market.place_order(
    entity, "stellium", OrderType.SELL, price=6.0, quantity=10000
)

# Instant trading
market.instant_buy(buyer, "stellium", quantity=5000, max_price=7.0)
market.instant_sell(seller, "rifter", quantity=1, min_price=300000.0)

# Cancel orders
market.cancel_order(entity, order_id)

# Check prices
prices = market.get_market_price("stellium", "jita_4_4")
# Returns: {'buy': 5.5, 'sell': 6.0, 'average': 5.75}
```

### Economic Features
- **Broker Fee**: 3% on order placement
- **Sales Tax**: 2% on completed transactions
- **Order Book**: Sorted by price (sell low→high, buy high→low)
- **Trade Hubs**: Jita, Amarr, Dodixie, Rens

### Data Files

## 🔍 Exploration System

**File:** `engine/systems/exploration_system.py`

### Features
- Probe scanning mechanics
- Cosmic signatures (Combat, Relic, Data, Gas, Wormholes)
- Scanner probe formation and positioning
- Scan strength calculation based on probe coverage
- Site completion and rewards
- Directional scanner (Proxscan)

### Components
- `ProbeScanner` - Scanner probes and scan capability
- `ShipScanner` - Directional scanner
- `ExplorationData` - Tracking scanned/completed sites
- `CosmicSignature` - Scannable signature in space

### Signature Types
1. **Combat Sites** - NPCs to fight, bounties
2. **Relic Sites** - Ancient artifacts, archaeology
3. **Data Sites** - Datacores, hacking
4. **Gas Sites** - Harvestable gas clouds
5. **Wormholes** - Connections to other systems

### Key Methods
```python
exploration = ExplorationSystem(world)

# Generate signatures in a system
exploration.generate_signatures("jita", count=5)

# Launch and position probes
exploration.launch_probes(explorer, count=8)
exploration.move_probe(explorer, probe_id, (2.0, 2.0, 2.0))

# Scan for signatures
detected = exploration.scan(explorer, "jita")

# Warp to and complete sites
exploration.warp_to_signature(explorer, "jita", signature_id)
rewards = exploration.complete_site(explorer, "jita", signature_id)

# Directional scan
nearby_entities = exploration.directional_scan(explorer, current_time)
```

### Scan Mechanics
- Probes have scan range and strength
- Better probe formation = better scan results
- Multiple scans needed to reach 100%
- Scan progress: 0-20% per scan depending on formation

    npc_entity, "serpentis_cruiser", current_time
)

# Loot a container
looted_items = loot_system.loot_container(looter_entity, container_id)

## 🚀 Performance Notes

All systems are designed to be efficient:
- **O(1) lookups** for most operations using dictionaries
- **Spatial partitioning** for proximity checks
- **Lazy updates** - systems only process active entities
- **Memory efficient** - components only added when needed

Recommended update rates:
- Manufacturing: 1 Hz (every second)
- Market: 0.1 Hz (every 10 seconds)
- Exploration: 1 Hz
- Loot: 0.5 Hz (every 2 seconds)
- Fleet: 1 Hz
