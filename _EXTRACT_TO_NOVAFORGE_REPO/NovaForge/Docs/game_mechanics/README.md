## 🎯 Key Structures at a Glance

| Structure | Type | Primary Role | Space Type |
|-----------|------|--------------|------------|
| **Orbital Skyhook** | Harvesting | Passive PI (Risky, Siphonable) | Nullsec |
| **Sovereignty Hub** | Control | System upgrades/resources | Nullsec |
| **Metenox Moon Drill** | Mining | Small-scale moon mining | Nullsec |
| **Communal Granary** | Boost | Mining yield bonus (Indestructible) | Wormhole |
| **Athanor** | Refinery | Moon mining (Medium) | All |
| **Tatara** | Refinery | Moon mining (Large) | All |
| **Keepstar** | Citadel | Supercapital staging (XL) | All |
| **CRAB** | Deployable | NPC combat for loot | Nullsec |

## 🔑 Key Features (2026)

### Industry Fitting System
- Structures now have slots like ships (High, Mid, Low, Rig)
- CPU and PowerGrid resource management
- Specialized modules for mining, defense, utility
- Example fits available in documentation

### Wormhole Changes
- **C1-C3**: 30% lower fuel costs + partial asset safety (new!)
- **C4-C6**: No asset safety (unchanged)
- **Communal Granary**: Non-destructible, provides system-wide mining bonuses

### Asset Safety
- **NPC Stations**: Absolute safety
- **Player Structures (High/Low/Null)**: Asset safety to nearest low-sec (15% fee)
- **Wormholes C1-C3**: Partial asset safety (15% fee)
- **Wormholes C4-C6**: No asset safety (full loot drop)

## 🎮 Design Philosophy

2026 structures emphasize:
- ✅ **Active Defense**: No more passive setups
- ✅ **Strategic Choices**: Specialized structures for specific roles
- ✅ **Collaboration**: Especially in wormholes (Communal Granary)
- ✅ **High Stakes**: Meaningful risk and reward
- ❌ **One-Size-Fits-All**: Gone - must choose specialization
