## EVE-Specific Mechanics to Avoid

These EVE features are not suitable for a small-group PVE focus:

❌ **Player vs Player (PvP)**
- Ganking mechanics
- War declarations
- FW (Faction Warfare)
- Sov warfare

❌ **Extreme Grind**
- Months-long skill training
- Capital ship requirements
- Alliance politics

❌ **Market PvP**
- Market manipulation
- Station trading bots
- Scamming contracts

## Conclusion

To achieve a complete EVE-like PVE experience, focus on:
1. **Economy loop**: Kill NPCs → Get bounties → Buy better ships/modules
2. **Risk vs Reward**: High-sec (safe) → Null-sec (dangerous but profitable)
3. **Progression**: Frigates → Cruisers → Battleships → Capitals
4. **Content variety**: Missions, Exploration, Mining, Industry
5. **Social features**: Corporations, Fleet operations, Shared goals

The current implementation has ~70% of EVE's PVE features (data structures for most systems, runtime code for core gameplay). Completing the remaining runtime implementation would bring it to ~90% feature parity.
