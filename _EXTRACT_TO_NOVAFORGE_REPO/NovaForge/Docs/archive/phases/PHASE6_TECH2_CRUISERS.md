#### New Classification Methods

```python
def _is_tech2_cruiser(self, ship_type: str) -> bool:
    """Check if ship is a Tech II cruiser"""
    tech2_cruiser_names = [
        # Heavy Assault Cruisers
        'Heavy Assault Cruiser', 'Vagabond', 'Cerberus', 'Ishtar', 'Zealot',
        # Heavy Interdiction Cruisers
        'Heavy Interdiction Cruiser', 'Broadsword', 'Onyx', 'Phobos', 'Devoter',
        # Force Recon Ships

## Technical Details

### Ship Balance Philosophy

Tech II cruisers were balanced using the following formulas relative to Tech I cruisers:

#### Heavy Assault Cruisers
- **HP**: Tech I × 1.4-1.5
- **Damage**: Tech I + 10% bonus per level
- **Speed**: Tech I × 1.15-1.25
- **Capacitor**: Tech I × 1.2
- **CPU/PG**: Tech I × 1.25

#### Heavy Interdiction Cruisers
- **HP**: Tech I × 1.5-1.6 (massive tank)
- **Speed**: Tech I × 0.85-0.95 (slower)
- **Inertia**: Tech I × 1.15 (less agile)
- **Warp Disruption**: +10% strength, +20% range bonuses

#### Recon Ships
- **HP**: Tech I × 1.2-1.3 (lighter tank)
- **Speed**: Tech I × 1.05-1.15
- **Targeting Range**: 86,000-100,000m (extreme)
- **EWAR**: +20-30% effectiveness bonuses
- **Scan Resolution**: 385-410 (very fast locking)

#### Logistics Cruisers
- **HP**: Tech I × 1.3-1.4
- **Capacitor**: Tech I × 1.3-1.6 (massive)
- **Remote Repair**: +25% amount, -15% cap use
- **Lock Count**: 9-10 targets

### Slot Layouts

All Tech II cruisers have 2 rig slots and the following patterns:

| Type | High | Mid | Low | Focus |
|------|------|-----|-----|-------|
| **HAC (Minmatar)** | 5 | 5 | 4 | Shield/Speed |
| **HAC (Caldari)** | 5 | 6 | 3 | Shield Heavy |
| **HAC (Gallente)** | 4 | 5 | 5 | Hybrid/Armor |
| **HAC (Amarr)** | 5 | 4 | 5 | Armor/Cap |
| **HIC (Minmatar)** | 5 | 6 | 3 | Shield/Tackle |
| **HIC (Caldari)** | 5 | 7 | 3 | Shield Max |
| **HIC (Gallente)** | 5 | 5 | 5 | Balanced |
| **HIC (Amarr)** | 5 | 4 | 6 | Armor Heavy |
| **Recon (Various)** | 4-5 | 5-7 | 3-6 | EWAR Focus |
| **Logistics (Various)** | 5 | 4-7 | 3-6 | Repair Focus |

### Resistance Profiles

Tech II cruisers have enhanced resistances:

**Shield Resistances** (HAC/HIC/Shield Logistics):
- EM: 10-15%, Thermal: 30-35%, Kinetic: 50-55%, Explosive: 60-65%

**Armor Resistances** (Armor HAC/Recon/Armor Logistics):
- EM: 60-65%, Thermal: 40-45%, Kinetic: 30-35%, Explosive: 20-25%

**Hull Resistances** (All):

## Integration

### How to Use Tech II Cruisers

#### Loading Ships
```python
from engine.data_loader import DataLoader

loader = DataLoader()
loader.load_ships()

# Access Tech II cruisers
vagabond = loader.ships['vagabond']
falcon = loader.ships['falcon']
guardian = loader.ships['guardian']
```

#### Spawning in 3D Client
```python
# The 3D renderer automatically generates appropriate models
entity_data = {
    'ship_type': 'Heavy Assault Cruiser',
    'faction': 'Caldari'
}
# Creates enhanced Tech II cruiser model automatically
```

#### Fitting Requirements
```python
# HACs require more CPU/PG than Tech I
if player.can_fit_ship('cerberus'):
    # Player has required skills
    # Ship has 450 CPU, 120 PG for heavy fittings
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- [ ] Tech II cruiser-specific skills (HAC, HIC, Recon, Logistics skill books)
- [ ] Tech II modules for full effectiveness:
  - Remote shield boosters
  - Remote armor repairers
  - Remote capacitor transmitters
  - ECM/ECCM modules
  - Sensor dampeners
  - Tracking disruptors
  - Target painters
  - Warp disruption field generators
- [ ] Tech II cruiser missions (Level 3-4 content)
- [ ] Special Tech II cruiser visual effects (enhanced engine trails, EWAR effects)
- [ ] Animated model components (rotating sensors, deploying bubbles)

### Balance Adjustments
- Monitor HAC DPS vs Battlecruiser balance
- Adjust HIC tank if too strong for Level 3 content
- Fine-tune Logistics capacitor sustainability
- Review Recon EWAR effectiveness in PVE
