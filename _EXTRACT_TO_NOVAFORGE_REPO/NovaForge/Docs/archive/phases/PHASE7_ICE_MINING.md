## Components

### IceHarvester Component

Represents an active ice harvester module fitted to a ship.

```python
@dataclass
class IceHarvester(Component):
    harvester_type: str = "Ice Harvester I"
    cycle_time: float = 300.0          # seconds per cycle (5 minutes)
    yield_amount: float = 1.0          # units per cycle (always 1)
    optimal_range: float = 12000.0     # meters
    capacitor_usage: float = 540.0     # GJ per cycle
    is_active: bool = False
    current_cycle: float = 0.0
    target_ice_id: Optional[str] = None
```

### Extended MiningYield Component

Now tracks both ore and ice mining statistics.

```python
@dataclass
class MiningYield(Component):
    total_ore_mined: Dict[str, float] = field(default_factory=dict)
    total_ice_mined: Dict[str, int] = field(default_factory=dict)  # NEW
    active_mining: bool = False
    target_asteroid_id: Optional[str] = None
    target_ice_id: Optional[str] = None  # NEW
    mining_start_time: float = 0.0
    yield_multiplier: float = 1.0
```

### Extended OreHold Component

Now stores both ore and ice.

```python
@dataclass
class OreHold(Component):
    ore: Dict[str, float] = field(default_factory=dict)
    ice: Dict[str, int] = field(default_factory=dict)  # NEW
    ore_hold_capacity: float = 5000.0  # m3
    ore_hold_used: float = 0.0
```

## Ice Harvester Modules

### Ice Harvesters

Two types of ice harvesters with increasing efficiency:

| Module | Cycle Time | Yield | Range (km) | Cap Usage | Requirements |
|--------|------------|-------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| Ice Harvester I | 300s (5min) | 1 unit | 12 | 540 GJ | Mining 4, Ice Harvesting 1 |
| Ice Harvester II | 250s (4.17min) | 1 unit | 14 | 600 GJ | Mining 5, Ice Harvesting 5 |

**Key Differences from Ore Mining:**
- **Much longer cycle times** (5 minutes vs 1 minute)
- **Always yields exactly 1 unit** per cycle (not m³)
- **Higher capacitor usage** (540 GJ vs 60 GJ)
- **Requires specialized skill** (Ice Harvesting)

### Ice Harvester Upgrades

Low-slot modules that reduce cycle time:

| Module | Bonus | Slot | Requirements |
|--------|-------|------|--------------|
| Ice Harvester Upgrade I | -5% cycle time | Low | None |

**Stacking Penalty**: Multiple upgrades have diminishing returns using EVE's stacking penalty formula.

## Ice Types

### 12 Ice Types by Rarity

Each ice type refines into different isotopes and materials used for fuel and manufacturing.

#### Common Ice (High-Sec)
- **Clear Icicle**: 500 Heavy Water per unit
- **Glacial Mass**: 500 Liquid Ozone per unit

#### Uncommon Ice (Low-Sec)
- **Blue Ice**: 300 Oxygen + 200 Heavy Water
- **White Glaze**: 300 Hydrogen + 200 Liquid Ozone

#### Rare Ice (Low-Sec)
- **Glare Crust**: 150 Strontium Clathrates + 350 Heavy Water
- **Dark Glitter**: 100 Strontium Clathrates + 150 Oxygen + 250 Heavy Water

#### Very Rare Ice (Null-Sec)
- **Gelidus**: 200 Hydrogen + 300 Helium Isotopes + 100 Heavy Water
- **Krystallos**: 200 Hydrogen + 300 Nitrogen Isotopes + 100 Heavy Water

#### Ultra Rare Ice (Null-Sec)
- **Thick Blue Ice**: 350 Oxygen + 250 Helium Isotopes
- **Pristine White Glaze**: 350 Hydrogen + 250 Nitrogen Isotopes
- **Smooth Glacial Mass**: 350 Liquid Ozone + 250 Oxygen Isotopes

#### Legendary Ice (Null-Sec)
- **Enriched Clear Icicle**: 400 Heavy Water + 200 Strontium Clathrates

### Ice Volume

**All ice takes 1000 m³ per unit**, making it significantly more bulky than ore:
- 1 unit ice = 1000 m³
- Typical mining barge with 5000 m³ ore hold = 5 units of ice
- Requires careful cargo management

## Ice Fields

### IceField Class

Represents a field of ice for harvesting.

```python
class IceField:
    def __init__(self, field_id: str, ice_type: str, system_id: str, position: Tuple[float, float, float]):
        self.id = field_id
        self.ice_type = ice_type
        self.system_id = system_id
        self.position = position
        self.remaining_units = 1000  # Large but finite
        self.spawn_time = 0.0
```

**Key Properties:**
- Each field contains a single ice type
- Fields have 1000 units initially (can be harvested by many players)
- Fields can be depleted and respawn on server downtime
- Position-based location in system

### IceFieldManager

Manages all ice fields in the game world.

```python
manager = IceFieldManager()

# Create ice field
field = manager.create_ice_field(
    "ice_field_1",
    "gelidus",
    "jita",
    (10000.0, 20000.0, 0.0)
)

# Get fields in system
fields = manager.get_fields_in_system("jita")

# Remove depleted field
manager.remove_field("ice_field_1")
```

---

## Ice Harvesting Mechanics

### Starting Ice Harvesting

```python
# Prerequisites:
# - Ship must have IceHarvester component
# - Must be within optimal range of ice field
# - Must have sufficient capacitor

result = ice_mining_system.start_harvesting(entity, "ice_field_1")
if result:
    print("Harvesting started!")
```

**Requirements Checked:**
1. **Range**: Entity must be within harvester's optimal range
2. **Capacitor**: Must have enough cap for one cycle
3. **Field Status**: Field must not be depleted

### Harvesting Cycle

1. **Cycle starts** when `start_harvesting()` is called
2. **Cycle progresses** over time (300s base, reduced by skills/modules)
3. **Cycle completes**:
   - Consumes capacitor (540 GJ)
   - Harvests 1 unit from field
   - Stores in ore hold (or cargo if full)
   - Updates statistics
4. **Auto-continues** until stopped or conditions fail

### Stopping Conditions

Harvesting automatically stops when:
- **Field depleted**: No ice remaining
- **Cargo full**: No space for ice (1000 m³ per unit)
- **Capacitor empty**: Not enough cap for next cycle
- **Out of range**: Ship moves too far from field
- **Manually stopped**: Player calls `stop_harvesting()`

---

## Ice Reprocessing

### Basic Reprocessing

```python
# Reprocess 10 units of Clear Icicle
products = ice_mining_system.reprocess_ice(
    entity,
    "clear_icicle",
    10
)

# Result: {'heavy_water': 5000}
```

### Skill Bonuses

Reprocessing yield is affected by two skills:

1. **Reprocessing**: +3% per level (max +15%)
2. **Ice Processing**: +2% per level (max +10%)

**Combined**: Up to +25% yield at max skills

**Example (Gelidus):**
- Base: 200 H, 300 He Isotopes, 100 Heavy Water
- With skills (Reprocessing 5, Ice Processing 5):
  - 250 Hydrogen (+25%)
  - 375 Helium Isotopes (+25%)
  - 125 Heavy Water (+25%)

---

## Usage Examples

### Basic Ice Harvesting

```python
from engine.core.ecs import World
from engine.components.game_components import *
from engine.systems.ice_mining_system import IceMiningSystem, IceFieldManager

# Setup
world = World()
ice_field_manager = IceFieldManager()
ice_mining_system = IceMiningSystem(world, ice_field_manager)

# Create ice field
field = ice_field_manager.create_ice_field(
    "field_1",
    "clear_icicle",
    "jita",
    (5000.0, 0.0, 0.0)
)

# Create mining ship
ship = world.create_entity()
ship.add_component(Position(x=0.0, y=0.0, z=0.0))
ship.add_component(IceHarvester())
ship.add_component(Capacitor(capacitor=1000.0, capacitor_max=1000.0))
ship.add_component(OreHold(ore_hold_capacity=10000.0))
ship.add_component(MiningYield())

# Start harvesting
if ice_mining_system.start_harvesting(ship, "field_1"):
    print("Harvesting started!")
    
    # Simulate cycles
    while True:
        ice_harvester = ship.get_component(IceHarvester)
        if not ice_harvester.is_active:
            break
        ice_mining_system.update(1.0)  # 1 second tick
```

### With Skills

```python
# Add Ice Harvesting skill (level 5 = -25% cycle time)
skills = Skills()
skills.skills = {'ice_harvesting': 5}
ship.add_component(skills)

# Ice Harvester I cycle time: 300s * 0.75 = 225s (3:45)
```

### Finding Nearby Ice

```python
# Get ice fields within 50km
nearby_fields = ice_mining_system.get_nearby_ice_fields(
    ship,
    max_distance=50000.0
)

for field, distance in nearby_fields:
    print(f"{field.ice_type} at {distance:.0f}m - {field.remaining_units} units left")
```

### Reprocessing Ice

```python
# Add reprocessing skills
skills = ship.get_component(Skills)
skills.skills = {
    'reprocessing': 5,      # +15% yield
    'ice_processing': 5      # +10% yield
}

# Harvest some ice first
ore_hold = ship.get_component(OreHold)
ore_hold.ice["gelidus"] = 10  # 10 units harvested

# Reprocess
products = ice_mining_system.reprocess_ice(ship, "gelidus", 10)

# Result with skills:
# {
#     'hydrogen': 2500,           # 200 * 10 * 1.25
#     'helium_isotopes': 3750,    # 300 * 10 * 1.25
#     'heavy_water': 1250         # 100 * 10 * 1.25
# }
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Mining Barges

Ice harvesting works with existing mining barges:
- **Procurer**: 12,000 m³ ore hold = 12 ice units
- **Retriever**: 22,000 m³ ore hold = 22 ice units
- **Covetor**: 7,000 m³ ore hold = 7 ice units

**Note**: Ice Harvesters require more CPU/PG than mining lasers, so fitting may need adjustment.

### Asteroid System

Ice fields are separate from asteroid belts:
- Managed by `IceFieldManager` instead of `AsteroidFieldManager`
- Different spawn mechanics
- Typically found in specific systems

### Skills System

Ice skills integrate with existing skill training:
- Use same `Skills` component
- Follow same training mechanics
- Can queue alongside mining skills

---

## Performance Considerations

### Ice Field Management

- Ice fields are persistent objects
- Each field tracks 1000 units (high capacity)
- Fields should be created at server start
- Remove depleted fields to save memory

### Storage Management

- Ice takes 1000 m³ per unit (bulky!)
- Monitor ore hold carefully
- Consider dedicated ice hauler ships
- Reprocess at station to save space

### Cycle Times

- Ice cycles are 5x longer than ore mining (300s vs 60s)
- Less server load per player
- Fewer inventory transactions
- More strategic planning required
