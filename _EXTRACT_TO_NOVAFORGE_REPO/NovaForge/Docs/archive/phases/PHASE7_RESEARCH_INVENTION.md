## Overview

The Research & Invention system allows players to invent Tech II blueprint copies from Tech I blueprint copies using datacores and optional decryptors. This system is based on EVE Online's invention mechanics with appropriate simplifications for Nova Forge.

## Features

### Tech II Blueprint Invention

Players can attempt to invent Tech II BPCs from Tech I BPCs:

- **Input Materials**:
  - 1x Tech I Blueprint Copy (consumed on attempt, win or lose)
  - 2x Datacores (different types, consumed on attempt)
  - 1x Decryptor (optional, modifies success and results)

- **Success Chance**:
  - Base rate varies by item type (18-34%)
  - Increased by science skill levels (1% per level per skill, additive across all required skills)
  - Modified by decryptors (+/- 10% to 90%)
  - Formula: `base_rate * (1 + skill_bonus) * decryptor_modifier`
  - Note: skill_bonus is expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.15 for 15% total from all skills)

- **Results on Success**:
  - Tech II Blueprint Copy with limited runs
  - ME (Material Efficiency) level: 2 + decryptor modifier
  - TE (Time Efficiency) level: 4 + decryptor modifier
  - Runs: base runs (1-10 depending on item type) + decryptor modifier

### Base Success Rates

| Item Type      | Base Success Rate |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Modules        | 34%               |
| Frigates       | 30%               |
| Destroyers     | 30%               |
| Cruisers       | 25%               |
| Battlecruisers | 20%               |
| Battleships    | 18%               |

### Science Skills

#### Required Skills for Invention

Players must have trained the required skills for each invention job:

**Core Science Skills** (10 types):
- Mechanical Engineering - Armor, structure, projectile items

All science skills:
- Prerequisite: Science 3
- Training multiplier: 3x
- Max level: 5
- Effect: +1% invention success per level (per skill)

### Datacores

10 types of datacores, each corresponding to a science skill:

- Mechanical Engineering Datacore
- Electronic Engineering Datacore
- Rocket Science Datacore
- Quantum Physics Datacore
- Molecular Engineering Datacore
- Graviton Physics Datacore
- Laser Physics Datacore
- Plasma Physics Datacore
- Nanite Engineering Datacore
- High Energy Physics Datacore

**Acquisition Methods**:
1. **R&D Agents** - Passive generation via research projects
2. **Exploration** - Data sites (future)
3. **Market** - Purchase from other players (future)

### R&D Agents

Players can establish research projects with R&D agents:

**Starting a Research Project**:
- Requires trained science skill (level 1+)
- Generates Research Points (RP) passively
- Generation rate: 50 RP/day per skill level
- No limit on number of concurrent projects

**Collecting Datacores**:
- 100 RP = 1 Datacore
- Can collect at any time
- Datacores added directly to inventory

Example: With Mechanical Engineering 5, an agent generates 250 RP/day = 2.5 datacores/day

### Decryptors

10 types of decryptors with varying effects:

| Decryptor                    | Probability | Runs | ME  | TE  |
|------------------------------|-------------|------|-----|-----|
| Attainment                   | +80%        | +4   | +1  | +2  |
| Augmentation                 | -10%        | +9   | +2  | +0  |
| Optimized Attainment         | +90%        | +2   | +1  | -2  |
| Optimized Augmentation       | +0%         | +7   | +2  | +1  |
| Process Decryption           | +60%        | +1   | +3  | +6  |
| Symmetry                     | +10%        | +2   | +1  | +8  |
| Parity                       | +50%        | +3   | -2  | +1  |
| War Strategon                | +40%        | +0   | +2  | +4  |
| Occult Data                  | +90%        | +0   | +0  | +0  |
| Accelerant                   | +20%        | +1   | +0  | +10 |

**Decryptor Effects**:
- **Probability**: Modifies success chance (multiplicative)
- **Runs**: Added to base runs of T2 BPC
- **ME**: Added to base ME of T2 BPC (base 2)
- **TE**: Added to base TE of T2 BPC (base 4)

**Acquisition**: Exploration data sites (future implementation)

## Skill Bonus Calculation

The skill bonus is cumulative across all required skills:

**Example**: Inventing a Caldari Frigate
- Required skills: Mechanical Engineering, Electronic Engineering, Caldari Encryption Methods
- If all at level 5: 15 total skill levels
- Skill bonus: 15 × 1% = 15%
- Base success for frigate: 30%
- Final success: 30% × (1 + 0.15) = 34.5%

With Optimized Attainment decryptor (+90%):
- Final success: 30% × (1 + 0.15) × (1 + 0.90) = 65.6%

## T2 BPC Statistics

### Default Runs by Item Type

| Item Type      | Default Runs |
|----------------|--------------|
| Modules        | 10           |
| Frigates       | 1            |
| Destroyers     | 1            |
| Cruisers       | 1            |
| Battlecruisers | 1            |
| Battleships    | 1            |

### Default Efficiency Levels

All invented T2 BPCs start with:
- **ME**: 2 (before decryptor modifiers)
- **TE**: 4 (before decryptor modifiers)

These are lower than researched BPOs but sufficient for profitable manufacturing.

)

# Result: 20 Mechanical Engineering Datacores
# Calculation: 4 levels * 50 RP/day * 10 days = 2000 RP = 20 datacores
