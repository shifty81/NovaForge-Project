- Can be tested and refined
- Then port to C++ later

**Option B: C++ Migration First**
- Better long-term foundation
- 15-25 weeks investment
- More complex upfront
- Professional executable result

**Option C: Parallel Development**
- AI prototype in Python
- C++ foundation separately
- Converge later

### Timeline Estimates
