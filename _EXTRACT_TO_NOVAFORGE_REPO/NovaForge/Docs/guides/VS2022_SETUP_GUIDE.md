# Visual Studio 2022 Setup Guide for Nova Forge

This guide will help you set up and build the Nova Forge project in Visual Studio 2022 after cloning from Git.

> **⚡ Quick Reference**: See [QUICKSTART_VS2022.md](QUICKSTART_VS2022.md) for a concise command reference.

## Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### 1. Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Visual Studio 2022** (Community, Professional, or Enterprise)
  - Download: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/
  - During installation, select: **"Desktop development with C++"**
  - Required components:
    - MSVC v143 or later (VS 2022 C++ compiler)
    - Windows 10 or 11 SDK
    - C++ CMake tools for Windows
    - C++ ATL for latest v143 build tools (optional but recommended)

- **Git** (to clone the repository)
  - Download: https://git-scm.com/download/win
  - Or use Git included with Visual Studio

- **CMake 3.15+** (usually included with Visual Studio)
  - If not included, download: https://cmake.org/download/
  - Add to PATH during installation

### 2. Clone the Repository

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/shifty81/NovaForge.git
cd NovaForge
```

### 3. Install Dependencies (vcpkg - Recommended)

The C++ client requires several libraries. The easiest way to install them is using vcpkg:

#### Option A: Quick Install with vcpkg

```cmd
# Clone vcpkg (if you don't have it already)
cd C:\
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat

# Add vcpkg to your PATH (optional but convenient)
# Or note the location for later use

# Install required packages (all in one command)
.\vcpkg install glfw3:x64-windows glm:x64-windows glew:x64-windows nlohmann-json:x64-windows imgui[glfw-binding,opengl3-binding]:x64-windows

# Optional: Install audio support
.\vcpkg install openal-soft:x64-windows
```

#### Option B: Static Linking (Single EXE, no DLLs)

If you want a standalone executable with no external DLL dependencies:

```cmd
.\vcpkg install glfw3:x64-windows-static glm:x64-windows-static glew:x64-windows-static nlohmann-json:x64-windows-static imgui[glfw-binding,opengl3-binding]:x64-windows-static openal-soft:x64-windows-static
```

### 4. Build with Visual Studio 2022

#### Method 1: Automated Build Script (Easiest)

> **Note:** All `.bat` scripts are deprecated. Use `build_all.sh` via Git Bash.

From the repository root directory in Git Bash:

```bash
# Navigate to repository root
cd /c/path/to/NovaForge

# Build all targets (engine, editor, client, server, tests)
./scripts/build_all.sh

# Or for a clean build:
./scripts/build_all.sh --clean

# Or build with tests:
./scripts/build_all.sh --test
```

This will:
1. Auto-detect your Visual Studio installation and vcpkg
2. Generate the Visual Studio solution
3. Build all targets in Release mode
4. Show you where the executables are located

The solution file will be created at: `build/Atlas.sln`

#### Method 2: Manual CMake Configuration

If you prefer manual control or the script doesn't work:

```cmd
cd cpp_client
mkdir build_vs
cd build_vs

# If you used vcpkg:
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:\vcpkg\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=ON

# Or without vcpkg (if using bundled libraries):
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DUSE_SYSTEM_LIBS=OFF -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
```

Then open the solution:
```cmd
start NovaForge.sln
```

### 5. Configure and Build in Visual Studio

Once the solution is open in Visual Studio 2022:

1. **Set Startup Project**
   - Right-click on `nova_forge_client` project in Solution Explorer
   - Select **"Set as Startup Project"**

2. **Select Build Configuration**
   - In the toolbar, select `Release` or `Debug` from the dropdown
   - Use `Release` for better performance
   - Use `Debug` if you need to debug code

3. **Build the Solution**
   - Press **F7** or select **Build → Build Solution**
   - Wait for compilation to complete

4. **Run the Client**
   - Press **F5** to run with debugging
   - Or **Ctrl+F5** to run without debugging

### 6. Running Tests

The solution includes several test projects:

- `test_asteroid_field` - Asteroid field rendering test
- `test_lighting` - Dynamic lighting system test
- `test_shadow_mapping` - Shadow mapping test
- `test_deferred_rendering` - Deferred rendering pipeline test
- `test_ui_system` - UI system test
- `test_network` - Network communication test
- `test_entity_sync` - Entity synchronization test
- `test_post_processing` - Post-processing effects test
- `test_audio_system` - Audio system test (if OpenAL is installed)

To run a test:
1. Right-click the test project
2. Select **"Set as Startup Project"**
3. Press **F5** or **Ctrl+F5**

## Project Structure

After building, you'll have:

```

```

## Troubleshooting

### "CMake not found"

**Solution:** Install CMake from https://cmake.org/download/ or ensure Visual Studio's CMake is in PATH:
```cmd
# Add to PATH (example):
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin
```

### "Cannot find glfw3.h" or "Cannot find GL/glew.h"

**Solution:** Dependencies not found. Make sure you:
1. Installed packages via vcpkg
2. Specified the toolchain file in cmake command:
   ```cmd
   cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:\vcpkg\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake
   ```

### "\Microsoft was unexpected at this time"

**Solution:** This error has been fixed in the latest version. Update your repository:
```cmd
git pull origin main
```

If still experiencing issues, ensure the batch file uses proper syntax with quoted SET commands.

### "MSBuild version is too old" or "Platform Toolset v143 not installed"

**Solution:** Update Visual Studio or install the C++ build tools:
1. Open **Visual Studio Installer**
2. Click **Modify** on your VS2022 installation
3. Ensure **"Desktop development with C++"** is checked
4. In the right panel, verify **"MSVC v143"** is selected

### Build succeeds but executable crashes on startup

**Common causes:**

1. **Missing DLLs** (if using dynamic linking)
   - Copy DLLs from `C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\bin\` to your exe directory
   - Or use static linking (see Option B in dependencies)

2. **Working directory not set correctly**
   - Right-click `nova_forge_client` → **Properties** → **Debugging**
   - Set **Working Directory** to: `$(TargetDir)` or `$(ProjectDir)\..\bin\$(Configuration)`

3. **Shaders or assets not copied**
   - Verify `shaders/` and `assets/` folders exist in the same directory as the .exe
   - CMake should copy these automatically

### "OpenAL not found" warning

This is **normal** and **optional**. The client will build without audio support. To enable audio:
```cmd
vcpkg install openal-soft:x64-windows
```
Then re-run CMake configuration.

### Visual Studio can't find the solution file

Make sure you're opening the correct file:
- Location: `cpp_client\build_vs\NovaForge.sln`
- If it doesn't exist, run `./scripts/build_all.sh` first to generate it

## Python Components

The repository also includes Python components (game server, demos, etc.):

### Python Setup

1. **Install Python 3.11+**
   - Download: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. **Install Python dependencies** (optional for enhanced features):
   ```cmd
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Python server** (for multiplayer):
   ```cmd
   python server/server.py
   ```

4. **Try Python demos**:
   ```cmd
   python launcher.py      # Interactive launcher
   python gui_demo.py      # Visual 2D demo
   python interactive_demo.py  # Text-based gameplay
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Typical Development Cycle

1. **Make code changes** in Visual Studio
2. **Build** (F7)
3. **Run/Debug** (F5 or Ctrl+F5)
4. **Test specific features** using test projects
5. **Commit changes** using Git

### Using Git with Visual Studio

Visual Studio 2022 has built-in Git support:

- **View changes**: **Git Changes** window (Ctrl+0, G)
- **Commit**: Write message and click **Commit All**
- **Push/Pull**: Use buttons in Git Changes window
- **Create branch**: Branch dropdown in status bar

Or use Git command line:
```cmd
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```

## Building the C++ Server

The repository also includes a C++ dedicated server:

```cmd
cd cpp_server
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build . --config Release
```

The server executable will be at: `cpp_server\build\bin\Release\nova_forge_dedicated_server.exe`
