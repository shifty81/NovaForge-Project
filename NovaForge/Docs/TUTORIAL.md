## First Launch

### Starting the Client

> See [docs/BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for full build instructions.

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Build first (if not already done):
./scripts/build_all.sh

# Run the client:
./build/bin/atlas_client "YourName"
```

**Windows (Git Bash):**
```bash
# Build first (if not already done):
./scripts/build_all.sh

# Run the client:
./build/bin/atlas_client.exe "YourName"
```

### Connecting to Server

The client includes an embedded server for solo play — just launch the client
and you're in. For dedicated multiplayer:

```bash
# Start the server
./build/bin/atlas_dedicated_server

# Connect with: ./build/bin/atlas_client "YourName" --server 192.168.1.100:7777
```
