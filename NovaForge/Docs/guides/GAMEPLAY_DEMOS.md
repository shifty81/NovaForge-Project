## 📝 Development Notes

The demos were created to showcase the full Nova Forge experience:
- Built on custom ECS (Entity Component System) engine
- Data-driven architecture with JSON files
- Server-authoritative multiplayer support
- Full EVE Online-inspired mechanics
- 100% moddable content

## 🎯 For Developers

Both demos use the same underlying systems:
- `engine/core/ecs.py` - Entity Component System
- `engine/components/game_components.py` - All game components
- `engine/systems/game_systems.py` - Core game systems
- `engine/systems/mission_system.py` - Mission management
- `engine/systems/navigation_system.py` - Navigation and warp
- `engine/utils/data_loader.py` - JSON data loading

The interactive demo (`interactive_demo.py`) provides a command-line interface while the showcase (`showcase_gameplay.py`) runs a scripted demonstration. Both can be used as references for implementing new features or creating custom game modes.
