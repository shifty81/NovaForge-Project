## Asteroid Fields

### Belt Sizes

#### Small Asteroid Cluster
- **Asteroid Count**: 5-10
- **Radius**: 30 km
- **Typical Yield**: Low
- **Spawn Locations**: Inner system, near planets

#### Medium Asteroid Field
- **Asteroid Count**: 10-20
- **Radius**: 50 km
- **Typical Yield**: Moderate
- **Spawn Locations**: Mid-system, standard belts

#### Large Asteroid Belt
- **Asteroid Count**: 20-40
- **Radius**: 80 km
- **Typical Yield**: High
- **Spawn Locations**: Outer system, dedicated mining areas

#### Colossal Asteroid Belt
- **Asteroid Count**: 40-80
- **Radius**: 150 km
- **Typical Yield**: Very High
- **Spawn Locations**: Prime mining locations
- **Note**: Often contested by multiple players

### Layout Patterns

1. **Cluster**: 5-10 large asteroids tightly grouped (2 km spacing)
2. **Semicircle**: Asteroids in a curved arc (5 km spacing)
3. **Scattered**: Random distribution across field (10 km spacing)
4. **Ring**: Circular ring formation (8 km spacing)

### Ore Distribution by Security Level

#### High-Sec (1.0 - 0.5)
- **1.0**: Ferrite, Galvite (abundant, high traffic)
- **0.9**: Ferrite, Galvite, Cryolite (abundant)
- **0.8**: Ferrite, Galvite, Cryolite, Silvane (good)
- **0.7**: Add Duskite (good yield, moderate traffic)
- **0.6-0.5**: Silvane, Duskite, Heliore (moderate yield)

#### Low-Sec (0.4 - 0.1)
- **0.4**: Heliore, Jaspet, Hemorphite (dangerous, NPC presence)
- **0.1-0.3**: Jaspet, Hemorphite, Hedbergite (very dangerous)

#### Null-Sec (0.0 and below)
- **0.0**: Hemorphite, Hedbergite, Gneiss, Dark Ochre (player controlled)
- **Deep Null**: Crokite, Bistot, Arkonor (legendary, alliance controlled)
- **Special**: Mercoxit in deep null (-0.5 and lower, requires special equipment)

### Respawn Mechanics

#### Daily Downtime (11:00 UTC)
- **Full Respawn**: All asteroid belts completely respawn
- **Server Maintenance**: Brief downtime for universe reset

#### Depletion System
- **Rule**: If a belt is completely mined out, it respawns **10% smaller** the next day
- **Recovery**: Takes 7 days to fully recover
- **Minimum Size**: Belts won't drop below 50% of original size
- **Partial Mining**: Partially mined asteroids remain until downtime

#### NPC Miners
- **Presence**: High-sec only
- **Behavior**: Visual only, do not consume ore
- **Purpose**: Atmosphere and immersion
- **Types**: ORE Mining Barge, Independent Miner, Corporate vessels

## Daily Gameplay Examples

### Typical Day in Gallente Space (0.5 Security System)

#### 11:05 UTC - Post-Downtime
- Downtime ends, all belts fully respawned to 100% capacity
- Check market in Dodixie trade hub
- Plan mining route for the day

#### 11:30 UTC - Travel to Mining System
- Undock from Dodixie
- Take Mining Barge (e.g., Procurer) to nearby 0.5 security system
- Travel time: 45 seconds per gate

#### 11:45 UTC - Arrive at Belt
- First colossal belt is empty - someone got there first
- Jump to next system (45 seconds)
- Competition is high immediately after downtime

#### 12:00 UTC - Mining Operations
- Find a "Colossal" belt with ore remaining
- Start mining operations
- Align ship toward safe station in case of gankers
- Mine Ferrite, Galvite, Cryolite

#### 13:00 UTC - First Load Complete
- Ore hold full (~5,000-10,000 m³)
- Warp to station:
  - Distance: 10 AU
  - Warp time: 20 seconds
  - Dock and refine ore
- Put minerals up for sale on market
- Return to belt for second load

#### Rest of Day
- Continue mining cycles
- Belts become progressively more depleted
- By evening, may need to find less popular systems
- Total daily income: Variable based on ore type and efficiency

### Mining Trip Breakdown (Hulk Example)

### Game Mechanics

#### Warp System
```
Total Travel Time = Alignment Time + Warp Time + Docking/Gate Activation

Warp Time = Distance (AU) / Ship Warp Speed (AU/s)
```

#### Belt Respawn
```
Daily Downtime (11:00 UTC):
  - All belts respawn to (current_capacity * 100%)
  
If belt completely mined:
  - Next day capacity = previous_capacity * 0.9
  
Recovery:
  - Each day unmined: capacity += 10%
  - Until capacity = 100%
```

#### Distance Calculation
```
1 AU = 149,597,870,700 meters
Warp speed varies by ship (1.35 AU/s to 10 AU/s)
Typical system: 100-150 AU radius
Gate spacing: 10-150 AU (avg 30 AU)
```
