# Quick Start - Phase 3 Features

## 🚀 Try the New Systems

### Manufacturing
```python
from engine.systems.industry_system import IndustrySystem, Blueprint, Inventory

# Create system and entity
industry = IndustrySystem(world)
player = world.create_entity()

# Start manufacturing
job_id = industry.start_manufacturing(player, "rifter_blueprint", quantity=1)

# Research blueprints
industry.research_material_efficiency(player, "rifter_blueprint")
```

### Market Trading
```python
from engine.systems.market_system import MarketSystem, Wallet, OrderType

# Create system
market = MarketSystem(world)

# Place sell order
order_id = market.place_order(
    seller, "stellium", OrderType.SELL, price=6.0, quantity=50000
)

# Instant buy
market.instant_buy(buyer, "stellium", quantity=10000)
```

### Exploration
```python
from engine.systems.exploration_system import ExplorationSystem

# Create system
exploration = ExplorationSystem(world)

# Generate and scan signatures
exploration.generate_signatures("jita", count=5)
exploration.launch_probes(explorer, count=8)
detected = exploration.scan(explorer, "jita")

# Complete sites
exploration.warp_to_signature(explorer, "jita", sig_id)
rewards = exploration.complete_site(explorer, "jita", sig_id)
```

### Loot and Salvage
```python
from engine.systems.loot_system import LootSystem

# Create system
loot = LootSystem(world)

# Loot containers
looted = loot.loot_container(player, container_id)

# Salvage wrecks
salvage = loot.salvage_wreck(player, wreck_id)
```

### Fleet Operations
```python
from engine.systems.fleet_system import FleetSystem, FleetBoosterType

# Create system
fleet = FleetSystem(world)

# Create and manage fleet
fleet_id = fleet.create_fleet(commander, "Alpha Fleet")
fleet.invite_to_fleet(fleet_id, commander, member)

# Activate bonuses
fleet.set_fleet_booster(fleet_id, booster, FleetBoosterType.SHIELD)
```
