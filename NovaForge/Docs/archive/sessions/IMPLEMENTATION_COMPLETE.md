## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### Architecture
✅ **Kept Python** - Working well, no need to rewrite
✅ **ECS Pattern** - Flexible and scalable
✅ **Data-driven** - Easy modding with JSON
✅ **Server-authoritative** - Cheat-proof

### Recommendations for Future
✅ **Short term**: Add more content in Python
✅ **Medium term**: Build C++20 3D client
✅ **Long term**: Hybrid Python server + C++ client

### Why This Approach Works
1. Don't throw away working code
2. Focus effort where it matters (3D visuals)
3. Keep modding easy (Python + JSON)
4. Incremental development (no "big bang" rewrite)
