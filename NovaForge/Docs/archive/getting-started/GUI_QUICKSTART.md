# Nova Forge - GUI Quick Start Guide

## 🎨 Visual Gameplay is Now Available!

Nova Forge now includes a **graphical user interface** using Pygame for visual gameplay!

## Installation

### Install Pygame

```bash
pip install pygame
```

Or install all requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the GUI

### Option 1: Standalone GUI Demo (Recommended)

The easiest way to see the visual interface:

```bash
python gui_demo.py
```

**Features:**

- ✅ Visual space representation with star field
- ✅ Real-time combat with weapon effects
- ✅ Health bars showing Shield/Armor/Hull
- ✅ Camera controls (pan and zoom)
- ✅ Combat log and status displays

### Option 2: GUI Multiplayer Client

Connect to a server with graphics:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start server
python server/server.py

# Terminal 2 - Start GUI client
python client/gui_client.py "YourPilotName"
```

**Features:**
- ✅ All features from standalone demo

## Troubleshooting

### "pygame not installed" Error

If you see this error:
```
Warning: pygame not installed. Run: pip install pygame
```

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Black Screen or No Window

If the window appears black:
1. Make sure pygame installed correctly: `python -c "import pygame; print(pygame.version.ver)"`
2. Update your graphics drivers
3. Try running in a different terminal

### Poor Performance

If the game runs slowly:
1. Close other applications
2. Update pygame: `pip install --upgrade pygame`
3. Reduce the number of stars (edit `gui_demo.py`, line ~98)

### "No module named 'engine'" Error

Make sure you're running from the repository root:
```bash
cd /path/to/NovaForge
python gui_demo.py
```

## Comparison: Text vs GUI

| Feature | Text Client | GUI Demo |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Ship visualization | Text description | Visual triangle with color |
| Health display | Text "HP: 450/600" | Color-coded bars |
| Combat feedback | Text log only | Visual effects + log |
| Space environment | Not shown | Star field rendered |
| Controls | Type commands | Keyboard controls |
| Frame rate | Updates per tick | Smooth 60 FPS |
| Multiplayer | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (gui_client.py) |
| Feature complete | ✅ Full features | 🔨 Basic visuals |

## What's Next?

The current GUI implementation provides:
- ✅ Basic 2D visualization
- ✅ Interactive controls
